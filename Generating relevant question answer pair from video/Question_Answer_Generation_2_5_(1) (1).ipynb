            "The golden bread once upon a time in a tiny village there lived a woman named marion with her only daughter narcissa marion was extremely humble and sweet narcissa however was completely the opposite you see she was beautiful beyond words she was like a living doll and the most amusing part is she loved herself to no ends narcissa would you help me bake the bread no way mom the flour made all my bright and sparkly eyes would you help me plant these seeds what why would i do that what if i got all that dirt on my lovely. What if it went on to my face well that was the problem with narcissa she thought herself too great to do any work many suitors came to ask for narcissist hand in marriage since her beauty was known far and wide but she rejected them all very rudely why did you send those men away yesterday they seemed nice you can't be serious mom one of them had such small eyes almost like a birds and the other head of huge nose i wouldn't want to be near him when he sneezed oh and the last stop no i don't want to hear anymore all i could see was that those men were really nice my dear you must know that beauty isn't everything. Mother you have to realize i deserve someone like a prince or a night oh dear one night when she was sleeping her mother sat at her side watching her my dear child you are so beautiful and lovely but you do not care about anything other than your beauty at that moment narcissists and giggles here sweetheart tell me what did you dream about last night well mom it was such an amazing dream you know there was this prince who came up to me and said that he wanted to marry me he is coming. Golden carriage and he was dressed from top to bottom and gold as well what a silly dream and you know the best part of it was when i was in my wedding dress which was of gold too of course everyone was staring at only me narcissa there's nothing amazing about that dream it was a very egotistical dream has made me realize that i need food much grander than the type i eat here at home just think of that poor narcissism that day two friends came to visit narcissist's mother they were melly. Harry the three of them had been friends for ages but terry and ellie had a secret both of them were magical beings something that narcissus's mother knew nothing about mary melly oh it's so good to see you it's been very long hasn't it so long how have you been i have been very good i would have been better if only if only what if only my daughter narcissist was a little more understanding marion told millie and terry all about narcissa and how she was worried for her she wants to eat bread made of gold what do i do with her well maybe if her dream comes true that would be wonderful wouldn't it. No matter i guess in time she will grow to learn let's talk about something else now later on millie and terry waved goodbye to their old friend and went away smiling to each other secretively that night both mother and daughter got ready for bed i really hope my dream comes true you know no narcissa the next day as narcissa and her mother were outside in their garden a beautiful golden carriage came riding up to them it was studded in gems and diamonds and looked extremely stunning as it stopped a handsome man came out of it and looked at narcissa she was completely taken aback at how handsome he was. My dream is actually coming what hello i have come here to ask for a narcissus's hand in marriage but how do you know her name and who are you i am terrence the angel of good fortunes your daughter's name and beauty is known throughout the world here i've brought you a gift i would love love love to marry you what but you hardly know him you can't go with him really he's rich and handsome what more could i want terence i accept your proposal and with that she got into his carriage and without even saying goodbye to her mother rode off with the angel as they were traveling the carriage suddenly entered a magical. They're at travel through a stormy area the carriage bumped around tremendously and narcissa was very scared what is that don't worry my dear all of this will soon be over oh just as he said this the carriage went through another portal and reach the driveway of a huge and magnificent golden castle narcisso was amazed at all the beauty she saw wow this is so beautiful i knew i deserve so many riches i knew you'd like it anything you want you will find here from the prettiest of dresses to the tastiest of foods all of it in my palace wow speaking of food i'm really. Free after that ride i'm starving can i have any of that tasty food of course here meet millie melissa she will get you whatever you want hi narcissa i've heard so much about you you poor dear you're hungry aren't you let's go to the dining table and i'll get you some food lol thank you they went into the dining room and there on the table was the most astounding food narcissa had ever seen the food looks amazing that's because it is the jams are made of rubies the salads of emeralds and the bread over there is made of gold golden bread how loudly this jam will look and taste lovely with the bread she took a slice with the ruby. On it and took a huge bite and the finest too but if you can't eat it should i get you silver bread silver why don't you eat something else but i want normal bread bread which i can eat don't you have that no no gold you must only eat the best narcissile looked at all the food but was heartbroken for everything there was inedible she soon started to cry let me go i don't want this what the food is really good here try some golden potatoes they're really. And after you're married to me you'll have to eat all of this i thought you liked fancy things i don't want to marry you i want to go home to my mother let me go home alyssa and terrence looked at each other and winked well if that's really what you want then i'll take you home terrence took the crying and unhappy narcissa home in the carriage she started to think deeply about the choices she had made when she reached home she ran to hug her mother who was sitting in the house sad oh my sweet daughter i thought i'd never see you again oh mom i love you so much and you were right. Looks and riches aren't everything the gold bread was useless as i couldn't eat it and the man even though he was handsome he didn't care for me at all but my dear do you realize that that is exactly the way you treated others i know i'm so sorry for the way i acted mom oh no it's all right since you've seen what your mistake was come let's feed you something nice from that day onwards narcissa changed her ways she struggled at first but slowly and patiently she started to become a lot nicer one day millie and terry came to meet marion again oh hello you too so tell us marion how's narcissism now marion told them both everything that had happened. She's changed so much from that time i guess she wouldn't want any more gold bread now huh you know terry you actually look a little like that angel though what am i saying how could you be him you two are so nice. \n",
